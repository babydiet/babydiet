Here’s a general diet guide for toddlers around 15 months:

Balanced Meals: Include a mix of grains (rice, wheat, oats), proteins (lentils, eggs, chicken, fish), and vegetables.
Fruits: Offer soft fruits like bananas, papaya, mango, or stewed apples for vitamins.
Dairy: Provide milk, curd, paneer, or cheese for calcium and healthy fats.
Finger Foods: Encourage self-feeding with boiled veggies, soft fruits, or small pieces of roti.
Hydration: Ensure water and other fluids like soups or buttermilk are consumed.
Avoid processed foods, excessive sugar, and salt. Keep portions small and feed frequently.
